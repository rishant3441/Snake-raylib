# Snake-raylib
A basic Snake clone built in C++ with the Raylib library

## About the Project
Snake. Nothing really much to say about it. This is just a simple C++ project to help me to learn and fully understand the language. This is officially my first completed project, so don't bash me, and instead give helpful suggestions with GitHub issues :). If you have any tips or suggestions that are too small for an issue, DM me with Discord, my username is rambo3441#6088.
